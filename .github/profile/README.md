# Welcome to Yieldex AI!

Yieldex AI is a modular yield aggregator that combines data analysis, artificial intelligence, and on-chain interactions to help you maximize stablecoin returns across multiple EVM networks. Our mission is to simplify yield farming by automatically gathering APY data, analyzing it through an AI-driven engine, and notifying you of the best places to allocate capital.  

## Key Highlights

- **Automated Yield Optimization**  
  Periodically collects and compares APY/APR data from various DeFi protocols (e.g., AAVE, Lendle), helping you discover the most profitable pools.

- **AI-Driven Rebalancing (Upcoming)**  
  Smart rebalancing that moves your funds automatically between yields on multiple chains, factoring in gas costs and token liquidity.

- **DeFi Transparency**  
  We store APY data trustlessly in a Mantle-based oracle contract, ensuring transparency for all stakeholders.

- **Telegram Alerts**  
  Get notified of major yield changes, new integrations, and recommended actions directly in your Telegram chat.

- **Developer-Friendly**  
  Our repository is organized for easy exploration and contribution. All key features—from data scraping to transaction signing—are neatly structured as Python modules.

## Get Started

1. **Explore the Codebase**: Delve into our [src](../..) folder for scripts handling data collection, analytics, notifications, and more.  
2. **Check the Docs**: Refer to our [README.md](../..) in the main repository to learn how everything fits together.  
3. **Contribute**: We welcome PRs for protocol integrations, AI enhancements, and performance improvements.

## Roadmap

- **AI Agent Release**: Automated yield rebalancing, daily reports, and advanced recommendation logic.  
- **Additional Protocols**: Expanding beyond AAVE and Lendle for broader yield coverage.  
- **User Dashboard**: Establishing a web-based UI for portfolio insights and one-click actions.
